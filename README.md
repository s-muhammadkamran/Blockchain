## Tools for Blockchain

Ethereum Blockchain Clinet (EVM)
Programming Language Compiler
Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### 1. Programming Language
    - Solidity (Most famous and the one Ethereum is written in based on C++ and Javascript like syntax)
    - Vyper
    - LLL
  
### 2. IDEs
    - Atom
    - VS Code (Supports Solidity)
    - Vim Solidity

### 3. Web based IDEs
    - REMIX https://remix.ethereum.org/
    - EthFiddle https://ethfiddle.com/
    - Superblocks Lab https://lab.superblocks.com/

### 4 Ethereum EVM 
    - Virtual Machine where Ethereum Blockchain can run. This is the only way to access Ethereum network.
    - Every node in the Ethereum network must run this.
    - This can be a full node or a Light node. Lighter nodes will only run part of the blocks of latest portion of the current blocks. Or on Demand get what is needed.
    - Options for Ethereum EVM are:
      - Cpp-ethereum - Language = C++ 
      - Ethereumjs.lib - Language = Javascript
      - Geth (go-Ethereum) - Language = GO - Get it from https://geth.ethereum.org/
      - Parity - Language = Rust = Get it from https://www.parity.io/ethereum or https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum 
      - Pyethapp - Langugage = Python - Get it from https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp - Deprecated
      - Trinity - Language = https://github.com/ethereum/trinity

### 5. Your testing environment (Simulated environment)
    - This is for testing your code, because once you deploy something on the public blockchain, you can't undone it.
    - Blocks and Transactions can only be Created. You can't Delete and Update and existing block/transactions.
    - Such environment are as follows
      - Ganache - Get it from https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
      - Truffle - Get it from https://www.trufflesuite.com/
      - Cliquebait - A docker instance - Get it from https://github.com/f-o-a-m/cliquebait
      - Local Ethereum Network - Easy to setup scripts to setup pvt blockchain network - Get it from https://github.com/ConsenSysMesh/local_ethereum_network 

### 6. https://etherscan.io/ 
    - Ethereum blockchain explorer. You need Account, this is the Ethereum network

### 7. myetherwallet.com
    - public and Private Keys (Your online Wallet)

### 8. https://andersbrownworth.com/
    - Online tool to simulate Hashing, None (Mining) and Blockchain.
